    "Welcome! This notebook is geared to give you starter examples of how to use ChatGPT for social media monitoring and analysis. Specifically we will look at three use cases:\n",
    "- Sentiment Analysis\n",
    "- Topic Extraction\n",
    "- Classification / Categorization\n",

    "For our purposes we will look at a series of tweets for Sam's club and do our analysis. I'll walk you through all the basic steps needed to do the analysis. \n",
    "\n",
    "NOTE: To make it easier to focus on the process of analysis rather than getting the data, I've included a JSON file that has curated output from Twitter (now called, X) in it. If you want to sign up for a developer account so you can get live data, go here: https://developer.twitter.com/"
